# Basic-Portfolio

as on 0915 EST on 11.04.2017 there are still formatting changes that I would like to make but I have run out of time.  I will continue to update to finish after homework is graded.
I need to make changes to rob-pic to give it a max size when we are on the larger screens to ensure that it does not take up too much room.  

I also need to make a few changes to .caption as when resizing the window the bars go past the photo at times. I would also like to set it to the bottom of the image so it does not cover the "main content" of the image
